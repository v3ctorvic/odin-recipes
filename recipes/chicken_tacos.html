    <h4>Chicken Tacos</h4>
    <p>Finding the perfect, juicy shredded chicken for tacos doesn't have to mean a trip to the store.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white distilled vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>8 taco shells, warmed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix water and taco seasoning of your choice in a large bowl. Add tomato sauce, vinegar, garlic, oregano,
            cumin, and sugar; mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes
            per side. Add tomato sauce mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
            chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken breasts from the pan and shred meat with 2 forks when cool enough to handle. Return shredded
            chicken to the pan with the tomato sauce. Cook and stir until chicken is coated with sauce and sauce reduces
            a bit, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving bowl and spoon onto taco shells.</li>
    </ol>
