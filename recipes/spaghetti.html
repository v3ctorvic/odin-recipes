    <h4>Spaghetti with meatballs</h4>
    <p>This authentic spaghetti and meatballs recipe is made with fresh oregano and parsley. Because the meatballs are
        cooked in the sauce, they are tender and savory.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh oregano, divided</li>
        <li>1 dried bay leaf</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound ground round</li>
        <li>½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked spaghetti</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook the onion until lightly brown. Mix in 2
            cloves garlic, and cook 1 minute. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, 1/2 the oregano, and
            bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer while preparing
            meatballs.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the ground round, bread crumbs, remaining oregano, remaining garlic, parsley, eggs, and
            cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Roll into 1 inch balls, and drop into the sauce. Cook 40 minutes in the
            sauce, or until internal temperature of meatballs reaches a minimum of 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil, and stir in the spaghetti. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, until
            al dente, and drain. Serve the meatballs and sauce over the cooked spaghetti.</li>
    </ol>
